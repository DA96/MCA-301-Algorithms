Q4. Suppose you are managing the construction of billboards on the university road,
	a heavily travelled stretch of road that runs west-east for M miles. The possible
	sites for billboards are given by numbers x1,x2,...xn each in the interval [0,M]
	(specifying their position along the roads, measured in miles from its western end).
	If you place billboard at location ‫xi , you receive revenue of  ri > 0
	Regulations imposed by the Delhi road authority require that no two billboards be
	within less than or equal to 5 miles of each other. You had like to place billboards at
	a subset of the sites so as to maximize your total revenue, subject to this restriction.
	Example: Suppose M=20, n=4
	{x1, x2, x3, x4} = {6, 7, 12, 14} and {r1, r2, r3, r4} = {5, 6, 5, 1}
	Then the optimal solution would be to place billboards at ‫x1 and x3 for total revenue
	of 10.
	Give an algorithm that takes an instance of this problem as input and returns the
	maximum total revenue that can be obtained from any valid subsets of sites.
