Q.11: Save Delhi City

Suppose you are Shaktimaan and you have decided to do something to save your
favorite city (Delhi) against the attack of Tamraj Kilvish, since no one else
surprisingly seems bothered about it, and are just suffering through various attacks by
various different creatures.
Seeing your passion, N people of Delhi decided to come forward to try their best in
saving their city. Now you have decided to strategize these N people into a formation
of AT LEAST K people in a group. Otherwise, that group won't survive.
Let's demonstrate this by an example. Let's say that there were 10 people, and each
group required at least 3 people in it for its survival. Then, the following 5 groups can
be made:
 10 - Single group of 10 members.
 7, 3 - Two groups. One consists of 7 members, the other one of 3 members.
 6, 4 - Two groups. One consists of 6 members, the other one of 4 members.
 5, 5 - Two groups. One consists of 5 members, the other one of 5 members.
 4, 3, 3 - Three groups. One consists of 4 members, the other two of 3 members.
Given the value of N, and K - find out the number of ways you can form these groups
(anti-squads) to save Delhi city.
