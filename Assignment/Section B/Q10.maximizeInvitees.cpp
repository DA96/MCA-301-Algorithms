Q.10: (Planning a party).
Alice wants to throw a party and is deciding whom to call. She has n (which is at least
11) people to choose from and she has made up a list of which pairs of these people
know each other. She wants to invite as many people as possible subject to the
following two constraints:
1. Every person invited should know at least five other people that are invited.
2. Every person invited should not know at least five other people that are invited.
Design an efficient algorithm for maximizing the number of people she can invite.
Remember to analyze the running time and correctness.
Hint: Maximizing the number of invitees is the same as minimizing the number of
people Alice doesnâ€™t invite. Obviously Alice might not be able to invite everyone. For
example, if one of the n people knows less than five people out of the n potential
invitees then the first constraint can never be satisfied for that person.
